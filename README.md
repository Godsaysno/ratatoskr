# Ratatoskr NoC simulator


Welcome to the project website of ratatoskr, a framework to design NoCs for heterogeneous 3D SoCs. It includes:

- A NoC simulator with support for heterogeneous 3D SoCs. In includes a high-level model of the router.
- A lightweight and efficient implementation of a 3D NoC router.
- Percise power models for links and routers.
- Integrated design tools.

It is developed at the University in Magdeburg, Germany and Bremen, Germany. The simulator is using C++14 and SystemCand is under MIT license terms. If you use the simulator in your research, we would appreciate the following citation in any publications to which it has contributed:
