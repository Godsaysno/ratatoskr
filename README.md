# Ratatoskr NoC simulator


Welcome to the project website of ratatoskr, a framework to design NoCs for heterogeneous 3D SoCs. It includes:

- A NoC simulator with support for heterogeneous 3D SoCs. In includes a high-level model of the router.
- A lightweight and efficient implementation of a 3D NoC router.
- Percise power models for links and routers.
- Integrated design tools.

It is developed at the University in Magdeburg, Germany and Bremen, Germany. The simulator is using C++14 and SystemCand is under MIT license terms. If you use the simulator in your research, we would appreciate the following citation in any publications to which it has contributed:

You can download the resources via this repo using a recursive git clone git clone --recursive https://github.com/jmjos/ratatorkr or directly on the individual repositories (VHDL router model and power models are shipped individually).

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Build Enviroment

- Ubuntu 18.04 & Boost Libs & pugixml
- CentOS 7 & boost-devel.x86_64 & pugixml-devel.x86_64
- cmake 3.10.2
- SystemC 2.3.3 www.accellera.org/images/downloads/standards/systemc/systemc-2.3.3.gz
- cmake assumes an installation of systemc to ``/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3`` If not the case, please modify simulator/CMakeLists.txt
- installation of 0MQ, see http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software

If you are using Ubuntu 16, you must compile against SystemC 2.3.1a!

##### Building with build script
We provide a build script, which relys on cmake. It is provided run it via:
```
> cd simulator
> ./build
```


##### Building with cmake
Go into simulator folder. Simply type
```
> cd simulator
> cmake .
> make
```

To use a subfolder and multi-thread build:
```
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make -j
> cp sim ..
```

##### Building with CLion

Works out-of-the-box using "Open Existing Project" and then opening the CMakeLists.txt in the prject folder. You need to change one thing which is, the Generation path:
- File -> Settings -> Build, Execuation, Deployment -> CMake. Now set the Generation path to the current folder i.e. '.'.

Enjoy.

##### Building with Eclipse

Open a workspace at the location "workspace"-folder. Then, create an new C++ project with the same name as the subfolder of the project you want to work on (i.e. a3dnoc-simulator). After applying the settings, you should be ready to go! 

Project Settings: 

```
> Dialect: C++0x  
> Preprocessor: -D SC_INCLUDE_DYNAMIC_PROCESSES  
> Includes: -I /usr/local/systemc/include   -I ./src
> Libraries: -l systemc, -L /usr/local/systemc/lib-linux64  
```

### Running the Software

Linking the shared libs globally via 
> sudo ln -s /usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/lib-linux64/libsystemc-2.3.3.so /usr/lib/libsystemc-2.3.3.so

or locally via 
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/lib-linux64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

or create a .conf file containing your SystemC library path (/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/lib-linux64) inside
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/


or in eclipse under run configuration, environment, new

you'll link the systemc Libraries.

Execute the simulator:

```
>./sim
```


## Configuring the simulator
The simulator takes three input files:
- config/config.xml for basic configuation. Warning: The path is static linked in the source code, so keep folder structure
- a XML file describing the traffic and a mapping file, mapping tasks to processing elements. Examples can be found in simulator/traffic

Run the simulator using ./sim.

Details on the configuration can be found in the documentation. 

## Model

### Router

The router model is:
- input buffered router with VCs
- variable number of VCs and buffer depths for each VC
- round robin arbitration over VCs (rrVC) or fair arbitration over used VCs (fair)
- routing functions implemented in routing; different deterministic and adaptive routings are given
- selection functions implemented in selection
- supports synchronous and asynchronous clock speeds of layers

To run the uniform random simulation please go to <a href="https://github.com/jmjos/ratatoskr/tree/master/scripts/urand">README.md</a>

## Documentation

Take a look at the [documentation table of contents](docs/TOC.md).

available for offline reading and provides a useful starting point for
any documentation you want to write about your project.
