# Ratatoskr NoC simulator


Welcome to the project website of ratatoskr, an in-depth PPA framework to design NoCs for heterogeneous 3D SoCs. It includes:

- Power estimation:
  - Static and dynamic power estimation of routers and links on a cycle-accurate level. 
  - Accuracy of dynamic link energy is within 1% of bit-level accurate simulations.
- Performance models:
  - Network performance for millions of clock cycles on a cycle-accurate (CA) level using the NoC simulator.  
  - Network performance for thousands of clock cycles on a register-transfer level (RTL). 
  - Timing of routers from synthesis on the gate level.
- Area analysis: NoC area from synthesis on gate-level for any standard cell technology.
- Verification: Gate-level model of NoC enables verification on gate-level against design rule checks (DRCs).
- Benchmarks:
   - Support for realistic application model on transaction-level. 
   - Conventional synthetic traffic patterns.
- Heterogeneous 3D Integration:
   - Heterogeneity yields non-purely synchronous systems, since the same circuit in mixed-signal and digital achieve different maximum clock speeds. Therefore, the NoC simulation and router hardware model implement a pseudo-mesochronous router (cf. Joseph et al. 2018).
   - Heterogeneity yields different number of routers per layers, since (identical) circuits in mixed-signal and digital have different area. Therefore, the NoC simulation allows for any non-regular network topology via XML configuration files.
- Usability: Single point-of-entry to set design parameters. The design parameters allow for rapid testing of different designs.
- Reporting: Automatic generation of detailed reports from network-scale performance to buffer utilization.

## Getting started

Here, we provide a quick tutorial. For in-depth instructions, please visit the [documentation](docs/TOC.md).

Let's start simple. You can a virtualbox image from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wDSwk0DIyzxVyD3pfzP4sBhK69QrsxN1). Boot it, login with demo/demo (user/pass). You'll find the simulator in ~/ratatoskr. We'll start from there. Let's start a terminal! (If you'd like to install the simulator on your own system, please read the detailed documentation in [the docs](TOC.md).

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr
```

In this demo system, we already installed all packages and ratatoskr, so you are ready to go. Let's first get the newest version:

```bash
git pull
```

and compile:

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr/simulator
./build
```

After a short time, you'll get the executable `sim`. Let's run three simple examples!

## Simulating a NoC for a heterogeneous 3D SoCs

In this part, we'll simulate a NoC for a heterogeneous 3D SoC with two 30nm mixed-signal layers on top an a single 15nm digital layer on bottom. We'll use YXZY routing, as published from *Joseph et al. 2019*, and load uniform random traffic. The result will look like this:

![Heterogeneous Traffic](bin/demo/uniform_hetero_network.gif)

Let's generate this figure. Enter the demo folder and copy the executable and the configuration files:

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/demo
cp ~/ratatoskr/simulator/sim .
```

We'll the the python venv and copy the required files for the GUI:

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/
make
source source_me.sh
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/demo
cp config/network_heterogeneous.xml network.xml #will be read as network config file for plotting.
python ../plot_network_client.py
```

The GUI script is started and waits for the simulation to run. Let's open a second terminal, in which you run the simulator:

```bash
cp config/config_heterogeneous.xml config/config.xml
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/demo
./sim
```

## Different traffic patterns

In this part, we'll run uniform random traffic pattern and hotspot traffic pattern and visualize the differences with our GUI. We'll use simple homogeneous networks for comparability to conventional NoCs. Copy the correct configuration files. In the `config` folder, you'll find the configuration of the simulator (`config_homogeneous.xml`) and the network, a 4 * 4 * 3 - NoC (`network.xml`). They are already set up for the uniform random traffic pattern. The simulation is set to 1.5M clock cycles, which will take a while. But that's enough to observe the behavior of the NoC in the GUI! Let's to that:

```bash
cp config/config_homogeneous.xml config/config.xml #for simulator
cp config/network.xml network.xml # for GUI
```

Rerun the simulation by executing `python ../plot_network_client.py` in the first terminal and `./sim` in the second.  A GUI will open and show the buffer usage in each router. It's somewhat random...!

![Uniform Random Traffic XYZ](bin/demo/uniform.gif)

At the end of the simulation after a few minutes, you'll see the performance results:

```
Generating report of the simulation run into file report ...  done.
Average flit latency: 13.86 ns.
Average packet latency: 46.64 ns.
Average network latency: 46.64 ns.
```

Next, let's use hotspot traffic pattern. Therefore, we configure the simulator. Close the GUI by pressing `q` in the window or using `Crtl-C` in the terminal. Change line 26 of the `config/config.xml` file from

```xml
<phase name="run">
  <distribution value="uniform"/>
  <start max="1100" min="1100"/>
```
to
```xml
<phase name="run">
  <distribution value="hotspot"/>
  <start max="1100" min="1100"/>
```

Rerun the simulation by executing `python ../plot_network_client.py` in the first terminal and `./sim` in the second. You'll recieve a rather boring but expected network load:

![Hotspot Traffic](bin/demo/hotspot.gif)

## Different routing algorithms

Let's use the heterogeneous XYZ routing, which puts more load to lower layers. This differs from conventional XYZ routing. Therefore, we reconfigure the `config/network.xml` by changing the router properties in lines 12, 19, and 26 from

```xml
<nodeType id="0">
     <model value="RouterVC"/>
     <routing value="XYZ"/>
     <selection value="1stFreeVC"/>
     <clockDelay value="1"/>
     <arbiterType value="fair"/>
   </nodeType>
```
to
```xml
<nodeType id="0">
     <model value="RouterVC"/>
     <routing value="HeteroXYZ"/>
     <selection value="1stFreeVC"/>
     <clockDelay value="1"/>
     <arbiterType value="fair"/>
   </nodeType>
```
Remember to repeat three times! Also, we'll use uniform random traffic again, so update the `config/config.xml` (revert the changes made before).

Finally, you'll receive the following:
